This project - Calculator for Large Numerical Values - is OOP implemented in both Python and C++. The C++ version is the most comprehensive and is less prone to errors. Both versions operate in the same way and leverage the multiprocessing approach.

Python version utilizes the multiprocessing library, while C++ version uses pthread. You will need to install pthread, please follow the instructions in the following resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GdTcqE0iqg.

# Python and C++ Library Choices
## Python Library:
- Numpy: This is a crucial library as one of the Python versions relies on Numpy extensively for its . library
- Numba: This library is designed for GPU . Even this project does not include the code using Numba because it's failed but I will talk about it a little bit.
- Multiprocessing: As the name , this library enables efficient multiprocessing on CPU, allowing us to take of the full potential of our hardware.
## C++ Library:
- String, Vector, Array, Algorithm, and more: These widely-used libraries are integral components of any C++ project, providing essential functionality and flexibility.
- Pthread: Similar to Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing library, Pthread enables efficient CPU multiprocessing, allowing for optimal utilization of system resources.
